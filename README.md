# Iris Flower Classification Project

This is a simple machine learning project that aims to classify iris flowers into three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements. The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook and uses the famous Iris dataset for training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

The dataset is available in the `sklearn.datasets` module and is commonly used for practicing classification algorithms.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment to run this project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
